#+title: Bash Learning Notes

* Overview
These are my personal notes while learning Bash, structured to eventually become a comprehensive tutorial website. The notes are written in Org-mode format.

* Project Structure
#+begin_example

#+end_example

* Content
Each topic is contained in its own =.org= file within the =notes/= directory.

#+begin_src org
,#+title: Topic Title
,#+index: 1
,* Main Heading
,** Subheading
,*** ...
#+end_src

+ =#+index:= determines the order in the [[* Table of Contents Generation][table of contents]].

* Table of Contents Generation
=build-toc.el= automatically generates a hierarchical table of contents in =notes/index.org= by:
1. Scanning all =.org= files in the =notes/= directory
2. Extracting titles, index numbers, and heading structures
3. Creating a numbered, hierarchical TOC with proper Org-mode links
4. Updating the "Table of Contents" section in =index.org=

* Publishing
** HTML Generation
=publish.el= script uses Org's built-in publishing system to generate a static website:
+ Converts all =.org= files in =notes/= to HTML in =public/=
+ Includes custom CSS styling and collapsible TOC functionality
+ Automatically cleans up orphaned HTML files (when source =.org= files are deleted)
+ Copies static assets (CSS, images) from =static/= to =public/static/=

** Build
#+begin_src bash
./build.sh    # runs all the publishing scripts
#+end_src

The build script runs =publish.el= through Emacs in batch mode for automated publishing.

** Dev Workflow
#+begin_src bash
./watch.sh    # starts dev server with browser-sync
#+end_src
