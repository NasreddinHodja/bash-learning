* Counting lines, words, chars
We use =wc= ("word count")
+ =-l= for lines
+ =-w= for words
+ =-m= for chars
+ =-c= for bytes

* Transforming text
=tr= command "transforms" text

+ usual usage is mapping one set to another:
#+begin_src bash
tr [:lower:] [:upper:]
#+end_src

+ =-d= deletes chars in set
+ =-c set1 set2= maps complement of =set1= to =set2=
+ =-s= squezes out repeated chars

* Converting tabs vs spaces
+ =expand= command converts tabs to spaces
+ =unexpand= command converts spaces to tabs

* First or last few lines
+ =tail= prints last =N= lines
  - =-n N= posix (*more robust to use posix options*); =-N= traditional
  - =-f= "follows" the file, printing end as it goes

+ =head= prints first =N= lines
